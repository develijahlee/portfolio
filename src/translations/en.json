    "p": "Creating exceptional products using the best tools available",
    "methodology": "I integrate code and design to create responsive websites that make the most of the least space. Cross browser compatibility is ensured by displaying core features on older browsers while newer browsers display enhanced features that enrich the user experience. I follow best practices and use semantic markup to ensure web content does not impede search engine crawlers or screen readers. I enable websites to be installable on mobile devices via progressive web applications to engage users even when they are without internet access.",
    "tools": "My dev tools include Sass, Git, Github, and NPM. I use Figma for design mockups, NVDA/VoiceOver to test for accessibility, and Google Lighthouse to test for performance.",

    "t1p1": "Elijah is agile in picking up and recognizing people's discomfort as problems. He solves them with his sharp insights and coding skills. What's even more amazing about observing his projects is that Elijah does all of this naturally and elegantly. It is undoubtedly clear that I will leave my website design to him next time",

    "t2p1": "I’ve worked with Elijah on a number of projects and one thing that was always apparent with his work is Elijah’s drive and forward thinking. Elijah is not one to settle for anything mediocre and is always motivated to further improve his work. His work in website development is of course no exception.",
    "t2p2": "Elijah had seen that our school’s student publication website had areas of improvement. Thus he took it upon himself to singlehandedly make a new website from scratch to replace the current one. Interestingly enough, we had no idea if his new website would even be allowed to replace the current one, but his passion and hard work had shown through as the school welcomed the change.",
    "t2p3": "Such an example shows Elijah’s initiative and skills to back up that initiative. Even now, he constantly strives for even further excellence on all of his projects. If you’re looking for someone who takes ownership over their work and is adaptable enough to make the right changes, I’d say Elijah is the one you’re looking for.",
